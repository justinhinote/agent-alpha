## What This Product Is

Agent Alpha is a CLI starter kit that removes the setup tax of starting a software product. Instead of spending weeks on engineering plumbing, founders can start building real features immediately.

## Why It Matters

Most early teams burn 2 to 6 weeks on setup work: repository structure, test harnesses, linting, CI pipelines, and merge protections. That delay slows learning, pushes out customer feedback, and increases the chance of expensive rework.

## What You Get

- A deterministic project initializer that creates a production-ready baseline
- A command generator so teams can ship feature commands fast
- Built-in quality guardrails (lint, type checks, tests, CI)
- GitHub-native workflow that avoids vendor lock-in

## Business Outcome

The starter kit is designed to reduce time-to-first-feature by more than 80%, with a target of shipping the first production command in under 3 days.

## How Success Is Measured

- Time to first feature
- CI pass rate before merge
- Setup hours saved
- Defect rate after merge
- PR merge friction

## Who This Is For

- Solo founders and lean technical teams
- Operators who need speed without sacrificing quality
- Teams that want predictable execution standards from day one

## 90-Day Vision

By day 90, the organization should have:

- A repeatable CLI development engine
- High-confidence CI discipline
- At least one production command delivering business value

## Immediate Next Step

Pick one high-leverage production command and ship it through this pipeline this week.
